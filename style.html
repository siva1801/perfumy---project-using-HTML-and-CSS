              <p>Released towards the end of 2022 this perfume by Paco Rabanne was by far the best selling fragrance for women over Christmas and still remains so now in 2023. Available in 3 sizes – 30ml, 50ml and the largest at 80ml. A great selling point with this fragrance is that it vegan friendly and the bottles are refillable with a large 200ml </p>

                <p>Although slightly sweet, this perfume is still creamy and marshmallow like with hints of coconut, praline and vanilla. Frequently sold out due to high demand, Ariana Grande Cloud comes in 3 sizes of Eau de Parfum- 30ml, 50ml and 100ml. Plus occasional seasonal gift sets but they sell out fast!</p>

                <p>A modern classic launched in 2014 this remains a best seller year after year. This is a long lasting Amber Vanilla fragrance with the most prominent note being coffee. It is perfume that can be worn all year round but we find it is most suited to the cooler months and evenings. Since the original was launched.</p>
